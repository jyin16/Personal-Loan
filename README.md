## Business Insights
Based on the work done above and bearing our problem statement in mind there are some key business
insights we have identified.
- 1: Identification of Key Factors
Through the analysis, the key factors that significantly influence customers’ acceptance of personal loans are
identified. This insight can help businesses understand the main drivers behind customers’ decision-making
process and focus their efforts on those factors to improve loan acceptance rates. Key Factors Identified:Income
level, Credit History, employment history, Age and experience.

- 2: Customer Segmentation
Customer Segmentation: The analysis can uncover different segments of customers based on their likelihood
of accepting personal loans. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing and
communication strategies to target each segment effectively. This segmentation can be based on various
characteristics such as demographics,income levels, employment status, or credit history.

- 3: Predictive Model
Developing a predictive model allows businesses to forecast the likelihood of a customer acceptinga personal
loan. Best Model we suggest is the logistic regression model which best suits this particular data set as well
as our problem statement enables proactive targeting of potential loan customers, leading to more effective
23
marketing campaigns and resource allocation.By accurately identifying potential loan customers, businesses
can streamline their efforts and improve conversion rates.

- 4: Risk Assessment
The analysis can also provide insights into the risk associated with granting personal loans to different
customers. By analyzing historical data and customer attributes, businesses can assess the creditworthiness
of potential borrowers and make informed decisions to mitigate risks. This insight helps optimize the loan
approval process and minimize default rates.This is something to consider for future use of this analysis as it
currently predicts loan acceptance and not loan approval.

- 5: Product Development and Offerings
Understanding the factors that influence customers’ acceptance of personal loans can guide product development
efforts.By identifying customer preferences, pain points, and specific needs, businesses can tailor their
loan products and offerings to better align with customer expectations.This insight can help differentiate
their loan products from competitors and enhance customer satisfaction.

- 6: Marketing Strategy Optimization
Insights from the analysis can contribute to optimizing marketing strategies for personal loans. By identifying
influential factors, businesses can prioritize marketing channels, messages, and promotional activities that
resonate with potential loan customers.This insight helps allocate marketing budgets more effectively, resulting
in higher customer engagement and conversion rates.
